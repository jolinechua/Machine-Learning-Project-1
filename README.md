# Machine Learning Project 1: Unsupervised Learning

This project analyzes mobile device usage data using unsupervised learning techniques. The aim is to uncover hidden user behavior patterns and segment users into distinct groups.  

---

## Overview
- **Objective:** Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering to identify mobile user segments.  
- **Main Points:**  
  - Reduced dimensionality with PCA while retaining ~90% variance.  
  - Performed hierarchical clustering to group users into heavy, moderate, and light usage categories.  
  - Identified key drivers such as app usage time, screen-on time, and battery drain.  
- **Tools Used:** Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

## Outputs
- PCA variance plots and feature loadings.  
- Dendrograms and cluster visualizations.  
- Behavioral segmentation insights for UX and marketing applications.
