# Machine-Learning-Project-1

Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality of a 700-user mobile device dataset and retain ~90% variance in the first few components. Conducted hierarchical clustering to segment users into heavy, moderate, and light usage groups. Identified top contributing features such as app usage time, screen-on time, and battery drain, with results highlighting practical implications for behavioral analytics, UX optimization, and targeted digital strategies.
